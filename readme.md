# Scientific Calculator

A versatile scientific calculator that supports basic arithmetic operations as well as advanced functions like trigonometric, logarithmic, and exponential calculations. This calculator is designed with a clean user interface and includes a help section to guide users on using scientific functions.

## Features

- **Basic Arithmetic Operations**: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **Scientific Functions**: Sine, cosine, tangent, square root, logarithms (log and natural log), and exponentiation.
- **Brackets Support**: Handles nested expressions using parentheses.
- **Help Section**: Provides instructions on how to use scientific functions.
- **Responsive Design**: Works well on various screen sizes.

## Usage

### Basic Operations

- Click on the number buttons to input numbers.
- Click on the operator buttons (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`) to perform calculations.
- Click `=` to get the result.

### Scientific Functions

- **Sine (sin)**: Input the angle in degrees and then press the `sin` button. For example: `30 sin` yields `0.5`.
- **Cosine (cos)**: Input the angle in degrees and then press the `cos` button. For example: `60 cos` yields `0.5`.
- **Tangent (tan)**: Input the angle in degrees and then press the `tan` button. For example: `45 tan` yields `1`.
- **Square Root (√)**: Input the number and then press the `√` button. For example: `16 √` yields `4`.
- **Logarithm (log)**: Input the number and then press the `log` button. For example: `100 log` yields `2`.
- **Natural Logarithm (ln)**: Input the number and then press the `ln` button. For example: `2.718 ln` yields `1`.
- **Exponential (exp)**: Input the number and then press the `exp` button. For example: `1 exp` yields `2.71828`.
- **Power (x^y)**: Input the base, press `x^y`, then input the exponent. For example: `2 x^y 3 =` yields `8`.

### Using Brackets

- **Open Bracket**: Click the `(` button to start a new expression within brackets.
- **Close Bracket**: Click the `)` button to close the current expression within brackets.
- Brackets can be nested to handle complex expressions.
